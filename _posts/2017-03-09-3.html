Thanks to [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) we now have a CI server building, testing and publishing on every commit in `develop` branch. All artifacts are available from https://repo.fagschlunger.co.at.

I also changed the way native libraries are loaded, since it's always a pain to keep the library path working. I use the approach [SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) is using. The CI server packages native libraries in JAR archives and publishes them as maven artifacts.
This allows us to retrieve native dependencies as they where java dependencies. Now since the native libraries are present in the java classpath, the `Library` utility class extracts them to a temporary directory and loads from this location. So hopefully there will be less `UnsatisfiedLinkError` exceptions.
