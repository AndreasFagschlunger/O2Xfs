## Setup Eclipse workspace

Before you start make sure you've completed the Development Setup and executed at least one successful build using `.\gradlew build`.

Start your Eclipse workspace and install the [Buildship plugin](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship):

https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/Installation.md

In Eclipse select `File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle Project` and click `Next`. Change the *Project root directory* to the O2Xfs repository on your file system and click `Finish`. You can safely remove the parent project `O2Xfs` from eclipse, since it duplicates the locations where files are found.

Before you run JUnit tests ensure your **JavaSE-1.8** execution environment points to a x86 runtime. In Eclipse open Preferences with `Window -> Preferences`. In the tree navigate to `Java -> Installed JREs` and ensure the JRE location points to a x86 version, otherwise `Add...` a new JRE. In the `Execution Environtments` node you can specify the JRE to be used by **JavaSE-1.8**.
